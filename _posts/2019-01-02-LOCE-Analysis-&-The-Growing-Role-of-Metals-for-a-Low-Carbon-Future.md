The rise of green energy technologies required for a low-carbon future is expected to lead to significant growth in demand for a wide range of minerals and metals, such as aluminum, copper, lead, lithium, manganese, nickel, silver, steel, and zinc and rare earth minerals, according to a new World Bank report, <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/207371500386458722/The-Growing-Role-of-Minerals-and-Metals-for-a-Low-Carbon-Future">“The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low-Carbon Future.” </a>

<b>Highlights:</b>

<ul>
	<li>Green energy technologies required for a low-carbon future will lead to a growth in demand for a wide range of minerals and metals</li>
	<li>The shift to a low-carbon future will result in significant opportunities for resource-rich countries</li>
	<li>The demand for specific minerals and metals is not only a function of the degree to which countries commit to a low-carbon future, it is also driven by intra-technology choices</li>
</ul>
