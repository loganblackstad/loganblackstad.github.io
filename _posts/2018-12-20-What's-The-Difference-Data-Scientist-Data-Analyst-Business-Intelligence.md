In my experience different companies will have different interpretations of each role. For example. I'm a BI Dev but I'm currently working on natural language processing, which is probably more broadly aligned with data science. In your situation, I'd focus on any and all statistics skills you have. Focus on R and Python as languages and that should start aligning you to data science roles. You already have access to relevant data sets so get funky with it! Make someone notice what you can achieve with those skills + existing data.

At the end of the day, all of these positions answer the same question: 

How to make more money, based on the data/information collected and available.
