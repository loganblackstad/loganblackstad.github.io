Credit should be given to Tim Dobbins - I cloned his repository for his GitHub Page. His layout was simple and easy to navigate.  I had to do a little leg work to understand html, css, and jupyter ingration. I am still learning.


First, I cloned his repository and commited it to my own GitHub Page repository "loganblackstad.github.io".

Then, I editted the _config.yml file in Sublime Text 3 to match my personal information.

THIS PAGE IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.
