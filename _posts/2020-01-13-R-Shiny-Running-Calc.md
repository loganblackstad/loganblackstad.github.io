<h3>R Shiny App: Calculate Running Pace & Mile Splits</h3><br/>

<b>Description:</b><br/>
I made this Shiny App because I was diassapointed that I could not find a simple online application or webpage for calculating my track 'splits' for distance training.  So I created <a href="https://loganblackstad.shinyapps.io/running-calc/">this simple calculator</a> to do just that.  

<b>Inputs:</b><br/>
HH:MM:SS = hours:minutes:seconds
D = distance

<b>Outputs:</b><br/>
Pace [minutes/mile] [minutes/km]
